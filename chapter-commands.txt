-- Chapter 2: Using the vi Editor --

vi and vim commands and navigation



-- Chapter 3: Working with the Linux Shell --


set
 - displays a list of all the shell variables and functions in the current process.

Shell Variable - exists only in the memory space of the shell in which it was created.
 - syntax:  <variable_name>=<variable_value>
 - to view contents of a variable:  echo $<variable_name>
Environment Variable - are visible to child processes, to convert a shell variable to an environment varible, an 'export' attribute needs to be assigned to the variable.

export
 - create environment variable, syntax:  export <variable_name>=<value>

unset
 - deletes the variable and removes it from the environment.

declare
 - displays the variable's properties, syntax:  declare -p <variable_name>  
 - a '-x' in the properties section of the output signifies that it's an environment variable.

alias
 - Command shortcut, syntax:  alias <alias_name>='<command>'

type
 - before creating an alias (or a variable probably), use type to find out if the proposed alias name is in use, syntax: type -a <proposed_alias_name>.


locale
 - locale settings are used to define output formats used by applications depending on the location of the computer

localectl list-locales
 - lists available locale names

localectl
 - used to view and modify system locale and keyboard settings

date
 - reporting information from and managing the system clock
syntax:  date +%<flag>
 %A - Full Weekday name
 %D - Date, same as %m/%d/%y
 %F - Full date; same as %Y-%m-%d
 %N - Nanosecond
 %d - Day of the Month
 %j - Day of the year
 %x - Date representation (eg., 12/31/25)

Time Zone Files:
 - /usr/share/zoneinfo
 - /etc/localtime
    - Both are used to configure a system's time zone: date, date +%Z, ls -l /etc/localtime, and timedatectl display the currennt system time zone

hwclock
 - manages the RTC (Real Time Clock), variants: hwclock, hwclock -r, hwclock --show

timedatectl and timedatectl status
 - view and manage system clocks

timedatectl list-timezones
 - displays a list of time zones

timedatectl set-timezone "<time zone>" changes the system-wide time zone

Bash Configuration Files:
/etc/profile
 - system wide configuration files
 - Contains commands used to configure user's working environment
/etc/bashrc
 - system-wide configuration files
/home/<user_name>/.bash_profile
 - Contains commands used to configure user's working environment
/home/<user_name>/.bashrc
 - used to configure Bash Shell features
/home/<user_name>/.bash_logout
 - Used to configure Bash Shell features, specifically used to perform operations on logout

Redirection:
heredocs <<
 - reads each input line from current input source until it reaches the 'limit word', which may be any word the user chooses
 - syntax (the example below will print out each line):  
   $ cat << RNDI
   > dummy
   > character
   > RNDI
   dummy
   character
   $      
 
Redirect stdout with > and >>
 - > 
    will create or overwrite an existing file
 - >> 
    will append to or create a file

Redirect stderr wtih 2>:
 - 2> and 2>>
    selects an alternate standard error file to write or append to  

 - 2>&1
    redirects standard error to the same location as standard output
    2> designates altering the data stream for error messages
    & is a boolean operator
    1 is the file descriptor number for the standard input device
 - 1>&2
    redirects the standard output to the same location as the standard error

 - &>
    redirects both standard error and standard output to the same file

 | 
   - unnamed pipe:  uses the output from the command to the left of the pipe as the input to the command on the right side of the pipe by creating a temporary file that Linux automatically removes.


-- Chapter 4: Managing Linux Users and Groups --

DAC - Discretionary Access Control - permit or restrict access to files

UID_MIN & UID_MAX - system variables that specify the range of user ids

/etc/login.defs - file that defines new user defaults

System Account - linux service/applications may have account IDs, typically between 0-99, with no password, no home directory, and no log in

/etc/passwd - flat file database that contains 7-field unique user records, delimited by colons
  format:  
        user_name:password:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:default_shell

/etc/shadow - flat-file database that stores user passwords and password aging expirations, each /etc/passwd record should have a corresponding /etc/shadow record

/etc/group and /etc/gshadow - group information is stored in group, and group passwords are stored in gshadow

w

  options:
	-c  change the user comment

passwd

	-w  set warning in # of days before expiration
	-i  set inactive days after pw expiration before account is disabled
	-S  display password aging information
	-e <username>  force user to change their password at next login

chage
